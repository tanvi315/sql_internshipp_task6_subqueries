# Task 6 - SQL Subqueries and Nested Queries

## Objective
To practice and implement SQL subqueries inside SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses using MySQL Workbench.

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench

## Concepts Applied
- Scalar Subqueries
- Correlated Subqueries
- Subqueries using IN, EXISTS, and =
- Nested queries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses
- Filtering using subqueries

## Description
This task demonstrates the use of subqueries and nested queries in SQL. I created two tables: `employees` and `departments`. I used subqueries to extract relevant data based on relationships between these tables.

## Queries Included
1. Subquery inside WHERE clause to get employees working in the IT department
2. Subquery inside SELECT clause to display department name with each employee
3. Subquery using EXISTS to list departments that have employees
4. Subquery in FROM clause to calculate average salary per department

## Output
All queries executed successfully in MySQL Workbench with correct results.
